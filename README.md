# Contact List Symfony #

Another project for my Coderslab PHP Course.

This time with Symfony 3 i created simple Contact Book in cloud.

After downloading repository and installing assets via composer install
don't forget to create database, update schema and create new users. 

This simple project allows you to create new contact's and manage them in groups.

User is managed via fos_user_bundle.
